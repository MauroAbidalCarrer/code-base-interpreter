    represents: an interface to a Jupyter kernel for code execution
    use_for: executing user-provided code snippets within a Python environment

response_parser.py:
  ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
    represents: the argument handling for function calls
    use_for: processing and passing the correct arguments to the function calls made
      by the model
  ChoiceHandler:
    represents: orchestration of decision strategies
    use_for: managing and executing the chosen strategies for outputs and function
      calls

  FinishReasonChoiceStrategy:
    represents: handling the terminal reason for a series of model actions
    use_for: managing the completion of tasks and reasons for ending function calls
      or text outputs
  NameFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
    represents: the strategy for calling a function by its name
    use_for: determining which function to call based on the model's generated output
  RoleChoiceStrategy:
    represents: a concrete implementation of ChoiceStrategy specific to handling role
      choices
    use_for: determining actions based on the role attribute in choices
