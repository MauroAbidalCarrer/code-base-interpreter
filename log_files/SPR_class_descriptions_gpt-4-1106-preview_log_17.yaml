bot_backend.py:
  BotBackend:
    represents: Central logic and state management entity that inherits from GPTResponseLog,
      encapsulates Jupyter kernel interactions, and handles OpenAI API configuration.
    use_for: Managing and orchestrating the bot's overall backend operations, including
      incoming messages, file handling, kernel management, and GPT model interactions.
  GPTResponseLog:
    represents: A storage container for intermediate state and responses during interactions
      with a GPT model.
    use_for: Logging and retaining information about the assistant's responses and
      function calls during a session with GPT model.

jupyter_backend.py:
  JupyterKernel:
    represents: An interface to a Jupyter kernel, enabling code execution and environment
      management.
    use_for: Executing code as per user instructions and managing the code execution
      environment.

response_parser.py:
  ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
    represents: a strategy for managing arguments for function calls mentioned in
      the assistant's response, in line with the ChoiceStrategy framework.
    use_for: adding argument strings for the function the backend is tasked to execute.
  ChoiceHandler:
    represents: a class that coordinates the execution of various ChoiceStrategy instances
      based on the assistant's response.
    use_for: managing the sequence of steps and applying the correct strategy to parse
      and handle each part of the assistant's response.
  ChoiceStrategy:
    represents: an abstract base class that defines a strategy for handling different
      types of choices during the parsing of GPT responses.
    use_for: serving as a base for concrete classes that implement specific strategies
      for dealing with choices in the response parsing process.
  ContentChoiceStrategy:
    represents: a concrete strategy for handling content changes in the assistant's
      response, conforming to the ChoiceStrategy pattern.
    use_for: appending content to the assistant's response.
  FinishReasonChoiceStrategy:
    represents: a strategy pattern for handling the finishing reason as stated by
      the assistant's response.
    use_for: determining the action to take when a response iteration is completed,
      such as making function calls.
  NameFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
    represents: a strategy for processing the name of a function to be called, as
      specified in the assistant's response and defined by the ChoiceStrategy.
    use_for: setting the function name that the backend needs to execute.
  RoleChoiceStrategy:
    represents: a concrete strategy for handling role changes in the assistant's response,
      as part of the ChoiceStrategy pattern.
    use_for: adjusting the assistant's role name based on the response's content.
