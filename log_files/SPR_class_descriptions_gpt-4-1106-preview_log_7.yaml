  ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy: &id002
    ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
      represents: A strategy pattern that encapsulates the algorithm for selecting
        function calls based on their arguments.
      use_for: When the function call selection is dependent on the types or values
        of the arguments passed.
    ChoiceHandler:
      represents: A class that handles the application of different choice strategies
        and manages decision making processes.
      use_for: When managing multiple choice strategies and needing to apply them
        to make decisions across various contexts.
    ContentChoiceStrategy:
      represents: A strategy pattern that encapsulates the algorithm for choosing
        content.
      use_for: When selecting content based on specific criteria and prerequisites.
    FinishReasonChoiceStrategy:
      represents: A strategy pattern that defines the logic for determining the reason
        a task has finished.
      use_for: When requiring to deduce or record why a process or operation reached
        completion.
    NameFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
      represents: A strategy pattern that encapsulates the algorithm for choosing
        function calls by their names.
      use_for: When distinguishing function calls in a code structure based on their
        name identifiers.
