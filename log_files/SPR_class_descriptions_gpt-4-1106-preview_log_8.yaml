  ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy: &id002
    ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
      represents: ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy offers a methodology for choosing
        arguments in function calls to optimize code clarity and function usage.
      use_for: Employ when designing function interfaces, determining argument order,
        or improving code maintainability through effective argument selection.
    ChoiceHandler:
      represents: ChoiceHandler acts as a controller for managing multiple choice
        strategies, streamlining decision-making across varied scenarios.
      use_for: Deploy in systems requiring coordinated decision-making, integrating
        multiple choice strategies, or in frameworks that support modular choice handling.
    ContentChoiceStrategy:
      represents: ContentChoiceStrategy provides a decision-making framework for content
        selection in interactive elements or dynamic systems.
      use_for: Apply when selecting content for display or output, adapting to user
        preferences, or responding to system state changes.
    FinishReasonChoiceStrategy:
      represents: FinishReasonChoiceStrategy encapsulates the logic to determine the
        conditions that complete or terminate a process or action in a system.
      use_for: Implement when coding exit points, establishing completion criteria,
        or handling termination conditions in processes or workflows.
    NameFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
      represents: NameFunctionCallChoiceStrategy guides the selection process for
        naming function calls, emphasizing readability and consistency.
      use_for: Use when generating code, documenting functions, or creating APIs that
        require clear and intuitive function names.
