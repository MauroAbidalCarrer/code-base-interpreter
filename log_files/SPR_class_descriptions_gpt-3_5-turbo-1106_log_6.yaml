  BotBackend:
    represents: BotBackend is a class that represents the backend logic and functionality
      for an AI code interpreter. It allows the user to execute Python code, manage
      conversation state, and interact with the OpenAI GPT model for chat completion.
    use_for: Interpreting and executing Python code, managing conversation state,
      and communicating with the OpenAI GPT model.
  GPTResponseLog:
    represents: The GPTResponseLog class represents the log of GPT-3.5 responses and
      the corresponding actions taken by the bot. It captures the history of the conversation,
      including the user input, bot responses, and any other relevant events.
    use_for: Preparing and maintaining the log of GPT-3.5 responses and bot actions
      during a conversation.

  ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
    represents: Represents the process of providing arguments for a function call
      within the context of the codebase.
    use_for: Using the class ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy is necessary to emulate
      the function arguments and handle the function response in the AI code interpreter.
  ChoiceHandler:
    represents: Represents the strategy for handling different choices within the
      context of the codebase.
    use_for: Using the class ChoiceHandler is necessary to handle different choices
      and execute the corresponding strategies within the AI code interpreter.
  ChoiceStrategy:
    represents: The ChoiceStrategy class represents the base class for different strategies
      used to handle various types of choices or decisions made during the conversation
      flow. It encapsulates the logic for executing specific actions based on different
      types of choices.
    use_for: Handling and executing different types of choices made during the conversation
      flow.
  ContentChoiceStrategy:
    represents: The ContentChoiceStrategy class represents a strategy for handling
      content-related choices, such as adding content to the bot's response. It helps
      manage the content of the conversation.
    use_for: Handling content-related choices, such as adding content to the bot's
      response during the conversation.
  FinishReasonChoiceStrategy:
    represents: Represents the determination of the reason for finishing an operation
      within the context of the codebase.
    use_for: Using the class FinishReasonChoiceStrategy is necessary to handle the
      determination of reasons for finishing operations within the AI code interpreter.
  NameFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
    represents: Represents the process of making a function call within the context
      of the codebase.
    use_for: Using the class NameFunctionCallChoiceStrategy is necessary to emulate
      function calls and handle function response in the AI code interpreter.
  RoleChoiceStrategy:
    represents: The RoleChoiceStrategy class represents a strategy for handling role-based
      choices, such as setting the assistant's role name in the conversation.
    use_for: Handling role-based choices and setting the assistant's role name in
      the conversation.
