    BotBackend:
      represents: The core logic of the chatbot functionality, handling input/output
        with the GPT model.
      use_for: Processing user queries and generating responses using the GPT model.
    ChoiceStrategy:
      represents: An abstraction for decision-making strategies in various scenarios.
      use_for: Implementing different algorithms for choice selection in response
        to user inputs or system events.
    GPTResponseLog:
      represents: A record of interactions between the user and the GPT model.
      use_for: Storing and retrieving past responses for analysis or debugging.
    JupyterKernel:
      represents: An interface to interact programmatically with the Jupyter kernels,
        responsible for executing notebook cells.
      use_for: Running and managing code cells in Jupyter notebooks through external
        commands.
    RoleChoiceStrategy:
      represents: A specialized choice strategy focused on role-based decision making.
      use_for: Determining responses or actions based on predefined roles within a
        system.

  ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy: &id002
    ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
      represents: "ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy manages the selection and ordering\
        \ of arguments in a function call, focused on the function\u2019s expected\
        \ behavior and the parameters' significance."
      use_for: Utilize ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy when it's necessary to
        define which arguments to pass and in what order to a function, considering
        the best practice and function design.
    ChoiceHandler:
      represents: ChoiceHandler is a high-level construct that interprets and manages
        different choice strategies to facilitate the decision-making process across
        various aspects of the system.
      use_for: ChoiceHandler is ideal for situations that require orchestration of
        multiple choice strategies to maintain coherence and efficiency in decisions
        that affect system behavior.
    ContentChoiceStrategy:
      represents: ContentChoiceStrategy encapsulates the logic for selecting the content
        that a system will provide or act upon, typically based on user preferences,
        history, and context.
      use_for: ContentChoiceStrategy should be used when the code needs to determine
        what content to display or use next, especially when there are multiple possibilities
        and the choice is not trivial.
    FinishReasonChoiceStrategy:
      represents: FinishReasonChoiceStrategy determines the reasons for finishing
        a process or task, which can inform a user of the outcome or decide on the
        next steps after completion.
      use_for: FinishReasonChoiceStrategy is suitable for scenarios where the system
        needs to conclude operations and inform users or other system components of
        the completion and its reasons.
    NameFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
      represents: NameFunctionCallChoiceStrategy deals with the decision-making process
        regarding naming a function call, which might involve conforming to naming
        conventions, readability, and contextual appropriateness.
      use_for: Employ NameFunctionCallChoiceStrategy when the code requires naming
        function calls in a consistent and contextually relevant manner, to ensure
        maintainability and clarity in codebase functions and methods.
