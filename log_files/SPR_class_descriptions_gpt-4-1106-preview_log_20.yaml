bot_backend.py:
  BotBackend:
    represents: The main orchestrator that extends GPTResponseLog functionalities
      to conduct Python code execution through Jupyter Kernel and manage conversation
      states for the user interface.
    use_for: "Executing user\u2019s Python code, managing the conversation history,\
      \ handling file uploads, and restarting the session."
  GPTResponseLog:
    represents: A storage and management container for responses generated by a GPT-based
      assistant.
    use_for: Capturing assistant's name, response content, invoked function details,
      and execution state across interactions with the user.

functional.py: {}

jupyter_backend.py:
  JupyterKernel:
    represents: An interface responsible for executing Python code in a Jupyter environment.
    use_for: Running code provided by users and capturing the output, which includes
      standard output, errors, and images.

response_parser.py:
  ArgumentsFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
    represents: Translation of argument changes into the bot's working memory for
      function calls.
    use_for: Preparing arguments for a function to be called and updating the conversation
      history accordingly.
  ChoiceHandler:
    represents: Managing the overall strategy selection and execution process for
      parsing model choices.
    use_for: Choosing the correct handling strategy during the conversation and executing
      the associated behavior.
  ChoiceStrategy:
    represents: An abstract base class setting a blueprint for various strategy implementations
      that handle different types of responses or decisions made by the GPT model.
    use_for: Creating concrete strategies that process specific aspects of GPT model
      responses, like role changes or content updates.
  ContentChoiceStrategy:
    represents: Translation of content changes into the conversation history.
    use_for: Updating the conversation history when the conversation context sees
      changes in content.
  FinishReasonChoiceStrategy:
    represents: Handling of the reason for the termination of a choice iteration.
    use_for: "Deciding how to proceed with the conversation flow based on the termination\
      \ reason of the previos model\u2019s choice."
  NameFunctionCallChoiceStrategy:
    represents: Identification and handling of function name changes within the conversation
      history.
    use_for: Designating a function for execution based on the conversation context.
  RoleChoiceStrategy:
    represents: A concrete class derived from ChoiceStrategy that is specifically
      tailored to handle cases where the GPT model changes role.
    use_for: Adjusting to role changes suggested by the GPT model in the context of
      managing conversation flow.
